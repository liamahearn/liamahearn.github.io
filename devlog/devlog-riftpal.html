        <p>
            I've been working on the beginnings of a website called <strong>RiftPal</strong>! 
            My initial goal was to make something stylish that worked with the <strong>Riot Games API</strong>, 
            and this is where it's taking me! Here's the elevator pitch:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                RiftPal is a website tailored around providing users with simple statistical trends 
                appearing in their League of Legends match history. The site enables users to more 
                quickly identify their weaknesses, and provides detailed statistics that explain in-game performance. 
                Providing streamlined analysis of champion matchups, RiftPal prioritizes simplicity and style to 
                form a general-purpose home base for casual League of Legends players.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Here's what I have so far:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A client-side <strong>home page</strong> that displays the user's account name and profile picture by communicating with...
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>NodeJS server</strong> that makes calls to the Riot API, retrieving information and serving as a level of abstraction for the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>Figma mockup</strong> (seen above), defining the general layout and design approach I intend on adopting for this project.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>software design document</strong> (a work-in-progress, which will become obvious in a bit), helping me to focus the scope, 
                nail down specifics, and predict roadblocks before committing to the more technically challenging elements of the project.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My hope is to combine the elements that I currently have and create an early version of the site that I am confident in before <strong>really</strong> moving forward.
        </p>

        <p>
            As of now, there's one big unknown that has halted my progress: <strong>I've never designed a database before.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I've tasked myself with organizing an <em>extensive</em> amount of data from players and League matches, and I'm pretty 
            much lost on how to go about it. I need to keep up-to-date, relevant statistics for players, and I need to store the 
            details of their past matches in a way that can be accessed quickly. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps, I have a database sheet(?) dedicated only to match history across all players, and another for players that holds 
            references to recent matches so they can be accessed efficiently. Is this much faster than simply searching for a player ID 
            across all matches? Probably. Is there a better way to organize this? Probably. My next task is to figure out what I'm going 
            to do, and do it.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Thanks for reading my first-ever dev log! I hoped that this would help illustrate the process behind what I'm making, as this 
            is my most ambitious solo project to date, and I think recording the stages of development is going to be very valuable. Take care!
        </p>
